QSOL-FIGMA: Meme Deployment Infrastructure (v0.1α)

Mission Statement:
To weaponize irony, humor, and absurdity using enterprise-grade Figma pipelines.
Because not every artifact needs to obey The Spec — some are meant to break it beautifully.

🧠 Overview

QSOL-FIGMA is a post-compliance subsystem designed to explore the unstable boundary between art, humor, and UI prototyping malpractice.
This repository represents the MemeOps Division of QSOL-IMC: a research unit dedicated to investigating why clicking things that say “haha” makes developers slightly happier.

⚙️ Core Principles
Principle	Description
Intentionally Inefficient	Render time should scale logarithmically with absurdity.
Interactive Nonsense	Every button must do something nobody asked for.
Aesthetic Chaos	If it looks slightly cursed, it’s probably correct.
Spec Violation = Feature	Non-compliance is logged as innovation.
Figma Is Funny Now	We stopped fighting it. It won.
🧩 Architecture

The system is composed of three primary components:

Frontend (Figma Make Runtime)
Where memes are prototyped, misaligned, and reluctantly exported as “design systems.”

Middleware (Emotional Damage Layer)
Converts user input into unexpected responses (e.g., “I can’t believe it’s not React!”).

Backend (Quantum Humor Core)
A hypothetical neural layer trained on Red Dwarf reruns, Australian satire, and open-source regret.

🔘 Interactive Schema
UI Element	Behavior
[Click Me]	Says something dumb, delays enlightenment.
[Deploy Meme]	404s intentionally.
[Enable Quantum Humor]	Disables logic.
[Comply with QSOL Spec]	Displays “Error: Comedy Not Found.”
🧪 Developer Setup

Clone at your own risk:

git clone https://github.com/QSOLKCB/FIGMA.git
cd FIGMA/src
npm run meme


If it builds successfully, that’s a bug.

🚫 Known Issues

Figma occasionally believes it’s an operating system.

Humor intensity may exceed workplace safety standards.

Occasionally passes the QSOL Spec validator by accident.
